        <p>
          Jow Ga Kung Fu is a traditional Southern Chinese martial art founded in the early twentieth century by Grandmaster Jow Lung. The name "Jow Ga" means "Jow family", reflecting its origins as a family system developed and refined over generations.
        </p>
        <p>
          The style was formed by combining established Southern Chinese martial traditions into a cohesive and practical system. It draws on the strong, stable hand techniques of Hung Gar and the agile footwork and kicking methods of Choy Gar, with additional Northern influences that broaden its range and movement. The result is a balanced martial art that integrates powerful close-range techniques with dynamic long-range movement.
        </p>
        <p>
          Training in Jow Ga develops structure, balance, coordination, and practical self-defence skills. Students progress through structured forms, partner drills, conditioning, and traditional weapons training. Each element builds technical precision, timing, and awareness through disciplined and consistent practice.
        </p>
        <p>
          At its core, Jow Ga is both demanding and accessible. It encourages steady development of physical ability, mental focus, and respect for tradition. Whether training for self-defence, fitness, or personal growth, students are guided through a clear and structured system that preserves the integrity of the art while supporting individual progress.

        <blockquote>
          "I want to teach good, honest people. There's no anger or arrogance. My class is a happy class."
          <cite>— Sifu Raymond Keung</cite>
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          Born in Hong Kong on 24 July 1959, Sifu Raymond began his training in Jow Ga in 1973. Initially reluctant, he was encouraged by his father to join a kung fu school to build strength and overcome introversion. When he arrived at class and recognised some of his classmates, his perspective shifted. He began to love kung fu.
        </p>
        <p>
          Under Master Ho Lok, Sifu Raymond developed the essential foundation of Jow Ga training: correct body posture, low stances, and the discipline required for serious practice. The training was demanding, but it established the structural principles that would define his development as a martial artist.
        </p>
        <p>
          Seeking to deepen his knowledge, he later trained under Master Yip Chi Wah, a direct descendant of Jow Biu's lineage. Here he expanded his understanding of hand forms, weapon forms, and set fighting. His dedication and exceptional memory led him to become known throughout the Jow Ga community as the <strong>"Dictionary of Jow Ga Forms"</strong> — a living repository of the art's technical heritage spanning over 20 hand forms and extensive weapon sets.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2003, Sifu Raymond immigrated to South Africa with his family and established the <strong>Jow Ga Kung Fu Athletic Association of South Africa</strong>, a life member and representative of the International Jow Ga Kuen Federation. He interviews every prospective student personally, maintaining the traditional approach to teaching that emphasises commitment, diligence, and consistent practice.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sifu Raymond also teaches <strong>Tai Chi</strong>, offering students the complementary art of controlled, meditative movement — the same attention to internal alignment and body mechanics that underpins his kung fu philosophy.

        <p>
          Training in Jow Ga is physically demanding and comprehensive. Each class begins with stretching and conditioning, followed by structured practice that develops strength, coordination, flexibility, and stamina. Students learn through forms, partner drills, and traditional techniques that have been refined over generations.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beyond physical development, training cultivates discipline, focus, and confidence. The structured progression through the curriculum builds both technical skill and mental resilience. Students of all fitness levels are welcome — training is adapted to individual ability, and steady improvement comes through consistent practice.
        </p>
        <p>
          New students are requested to call ahead before attending their first class. Classes are available on weekdays and weekends.

        <p>
          Taught by Sifu Raymond alongside Jow Ga, Tai Chi offers a complementary practice focused on internal development. It emphasises controlled movement, breath, balance, and alignment — cultivating mental clarity and physical awareness through disciplined, meditative practice.
        </p>
        <p>
          Tai Chi is suitable for practitioners of all ages and fitness levels. It can be studied as a standalone art or as a complement to kung fu training. No prior martial arts experience is required.
        </p>

      </div>
      <div class="faq-item">
        <p class="faq-q">How is Jow Ga different from other kung fu styles?</p>
        <p class="faq-a">Jow Ga combines three established systems: Hung Gar's powerful striking, Choy Gar's agile footwork, and Northern Shaolin's long-range techniques. The result is a comprehensive martial art that integrates multiple ranges and methods into a unified system.</p>

            When the Jow Ga Five Tigers established the first Jow Ga school, they named it <em>Zhou Jia Quan Ren Yi Tang</em> — the "Jow Family Boxing's Hall of Benevolence and Justice." This name reflects the philosophy at the heart of traditional martial arts training: you must first be a good person, then a good martial artist.
          </p>
          <p>
            The following code of conduct guides all students in their training and conduct. These principles are expected to be observed both in the kwoon and beyond.
          </p>
        </div>

        <ol class="code-list">
          <li>Refer to your teacher as "Sifu" — a title for someone who has achieved mastery of an art.</li>
          <li>Show respect for instructors, senior classmates, and fellow students.</li>
          <li>Pay respect with the Jow Ga salute (left palm over right fist) when entering and leaving class.</li>
          <li>When addressing an instructor, salute first as a matter of courtesy. Extend similar courtesies when receiving guests or visiting other schools.</li>
          <li>Do not eat during class. Drinking water is permitted during breaks.</li>
          <li>Do not chat or talk loudly during class.</li>
          <li>Profanity is not permitted.</li>
          <li>Do not be late for class without informing Sifu or without valid reason.</li>
          <li>Students must be dressed and ready five minutes before training begins.</li>
          <li>Respect the effort of others, even if they make mistakes. No one is perfect, and there is always room for improvement.</li>
          <li>Offer help to those who need it, even if they do not ask.</li>
          <li>Do not teach others or practise techniques you have not been taught without Sifu's permission.</li>
          <li>Do not misuse your knowledge of kung fu, especially against those less experienced or unable to defend themselves. Abuse of martial arts skill will not be tolerated.</li>
          <li>Do not disparage other martial arts styles, schools, or their members. There is always something to learn from others.</li>
          <li>Be humble. In public, do not boast or behave in a manner that reflects poorly on the Association, your classmates, or your instructors. As practitioners of Jow Ga Kung Fu, strive to be exemplary in all aspects of life.</li>
